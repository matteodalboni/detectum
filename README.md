# DeTecTUM â€” Decomposition Techniques with Thrifty Use of Memory
A lightweight linear algebra library offering a wide selection of matrix decompositions and solvers for real-valued dense matrices.

One of the distinctive traits of DeTecTUM is that all the algorithms are built around in-place operations, ensuring a minimal memory footprint. Fully implemented in plain C, the library adopts single-precision arithmetic and avoids dynamic memory allocation. All of these features also make DeTecTUM ideal for most embedded systems.

The library includes:
* Cholesky decomposition;
* LU decomposition;
* QR decomposition;
* bidiagonal decomposition;
* complete orthogonal decomposition (COD);
* singular value decomposition (SVD);
* Hessenberg decomposition;
* Schur decomposition;
* eigenvector computation;
* pseudo-eigenvector computation;
* solver for lower-triangular systems;
* solver for upper-triangular systems;
* solver for symmetric positive definite systems;
* solver for banded Hessenberg systems;
* solver for square full-rank systems;
* solver for general full-rank systems;
* solver for general rank-deficient systems;
* minimum-norm solver;
* Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse;
* matrix exponential;
* real matrix logarithm;
* real matrix square root.
