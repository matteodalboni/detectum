# DeTeGo â€” *De*composition *Te*chniques designed for on-the-*Go* use
A linear algebra library offering a wide selection of matrix decompositions and direct solvers for real-valued dense matrices.

One of the distinctive traits of *DeTeGo* is that all the algorithms are built around in-place operations, ensuring a minimal memory footprint. Fully implemented in plain C, the library adopts single-precision arithmetic and avoids dynamic memory allocation. All of these features make *DeTeGo* ideal for embedded systems, too.

The library includes:
* Cholesky decomposition;
* LTL' decomposition;
* LU decomposition;
* QR decomposition;
* bidiagonalization;
* singular value decomposition (SVD);
* Hessenberg decomposition;
* Schur decomposition;
* eigenvector computation;
* pseudo-eigenvector computation;
* solver for lower-triangular systems;
* solver for upper-triangular systems;
* solver for tridiagonal systems;
* solver for symmetric positive definite systems;
* solver for symmetric indefinite systems;
* solver for full-rank square systems;
* least-squares solver for full-rank systems;
* solver for underdetermined and overdetermined systems;  
* minimum-norm solver;
* Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse computation;
* matrix exponential computation;
* matrix exponentiation to positive integer power.
