# verto
A linear algebra library offering a wide selection of matrix decompositions and solvers.

One of the distinctive traits of *verto* is that all the algorithms are built upon in-place operations. This ensures a very small memory footprint. The library is fully implemented in plain C language, exploits single-precision arithmetic, and makes no use of dynamic memory allocation. All of these features make *verto* ideal for microcontrollers.
