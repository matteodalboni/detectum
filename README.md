# detego
A linear algebra library offering a wide selection of matrix decompositions and direct solvers for real-valued dense matrices.

One of the distinctive traits of *detego* is that all the algorithms are built around in-place operations, ensuring a minimal memory footprint. Fully implemented in plain C, the library adopts single-precision arithmetic and avoids dynamic memory allocation. All of these features make *detego* ideal for embedded systems.
